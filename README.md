# realtime-chess-ai

This is a part of our final project submission. We have created a Chess AI by using training a CNN to score a board while time a reference from stockfish. 

Using this score and a minimax based search, the AI generated a move. We also have an interface designed to showcase these moves.

We are using parallel GPU compute to make the bot play chess at a very fast pace. We also go over all the algorithms required to implement this.

To reproduce our results, you need to:

1. Reproduce the data using Data Gen files.
2. Aggregate the data using aggregation script.
3. Train using trymodels.py
4. Deploy and play against the AI using one of the minimax files.
